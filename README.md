# work-day-scheduler
***Third-Party APIs Challenge***

This application uses jquery, bootstrap, and moment.js to allow you to plan out your work day. You can write out your schedule for each hour and the app will help you keep track of time by coloring each hour with colors for past, present, and future.
Each input will remain when you refresh as long as you clicked the blue save button on the right until you delete the input manually and click the save button.
